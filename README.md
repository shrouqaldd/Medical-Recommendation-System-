# Medical-Recommendation-System-
a medical recommendation system that uses machine learning techniques to diagnose diseases based on symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment, which include descriptions, precautions, medications, workouts, and diet suggestions.. It involves data preprocessing, training various machine learning models.



## Workflow  
1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, splitting).  
2. Train models (ML & DL).  
3. Evaluate performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1).  
4. Generate recommendations for predicted disease.  

## Models & Results  

- **Machine Learning**:  
  - Algorithms:  SVC, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, MultinomialNB

- **Deep Learning (ANN)**:  
  - 3 Dense hidden layers with Dropout & BatchNorm.
